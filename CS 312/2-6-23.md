LAST TIME WE ENDED ON THE EXAMPLE OF HTTP REQUESTS AND RESPONSES
* Response code: comes from the service; it is not an error code, it sends the status; 1 something is requesting, 2 is success, 3 is redirection, 4 is client error, 5 is server error
* Web page request
    1. enter url
    2. sends url to DNS
    3. DNS finds the IP address
    4. sends message to the IP
    5. locates the representation on the server
    6. server sends response
    7. then can go back and forth between the client (browser) and the server

* png and jpg is a compression mechanism for the images
HTTP Redirect: resource has been moved to a new location; server responds with URI of new location, client must ...
content type is in the header (eg. text)
* Multimedia Internet Mail Extensions (MIME)
    * defines plain text encoding for media attachments
        * SMTP (email) requires all data to be 7 bit ASCII characters
        * all non-ASCII data must be encoded as ASCII strings
        * Eg. text/html, image/jpeg, audio/mpeg, etc
## Security
* HTTPS: hypertext transfer protocol secure
    * transfereed using http, encrypted with default TCP port 443
    * for web pages the URI begins with https://
    * provides *server only* authentication (not client)

* transport layer security ITLS)
    * works above TCP but below application protocols (eg. HTTP, SMTP, etc)
    * Protocol Steps:
        1. Certificate authentication (usuallly server authentication only)
        2. encryption key registration
        3. encryption/decryption of message
* encryption is a delay mechanism
    * only one encryption system that is not breakable but is not practical for large amounts of data
    * the sorter the key, the easier it is to break
    * level of protection you give is based on what you are trying to protect
