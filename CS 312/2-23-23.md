## What is HTML
* Hypertext markup language is used to format webpages, is a markup language 
    * Markup Language: describes formatting rather than function
    * (html == markup language) != programming language
* look at W3Schools for html help
* 1989- simple version developed by Tim Berners-Lee
* 1997 HTML 3.2 first common standard for html
* 1998 html 4.01 specified a clear relationship between HTML and JavaScript/PHP things, and introduced style sheets (CSS)
* 2000 xhtml 1.0 basically html 4.01 which strict syntax standards of xml (xml is a microsoft formatting language)
* 2008 html 5 combines xhtml, CSS3, MathML, and SVG

Basic Format of an HTML Page:
````
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" lang="en">
<head>
	<meta charset="UTF-8"/>
	<title>webpage title here</title>
…header information goes here…
</head>

<body>
…body information goes here…
</body>
</html>

````
* UTF-8 is an extended ASCII character set
* meta means it is something to be used throughout
* title is the title that will be shown for the webpage throughout
Structure Tags
````
<tagName>
Opening tag – some type of command or formatting
</tagName>
Closing tag – ends the formatting

<html> … </html> 
Indicates start and end of an HTML document
<head> … </head> 
Header information (not displayed in the browser window)
<title> … </title>
The title is displayed in your browser's caption (title bar)
````

* for the most part, there are two rules (but there are exceptions)
    1. All tags must be lowercase
    2. All opening tags must have a closing tag (closing tag has a `</`tagName`>`)
````
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" lang="en">
<head>
	<meta charset="UTF-8"/>
	<title>webpage title here</title>
…header information goes here…
</head>

<body>
…body information goes here…
</body>
</html>
````
* There are default values for *everything* (eg. character set, fonts, colors, etc.)
* anything you declare in the header you can override in the code with other stuff


Main HTML Elements
* Top Level elements
    * html
    head
    body
* head elements (inside head)
    * title
    style
    link
    meta
    base
    script
* block level elements (behave like paragraphs)
    h1-h6 (headers)
    p
    pre (comes out exactly like it was in; "preformatted")
    ul (unnumbered lines)
    ol (numbered/ordered lines)
    table
    form (there are built in HTML ones and you can make custom ones)
* inline elements (behave like words)
    * a (images link)
    br (break)
    code (put in code)
    img
    em (emphasis/italics)
    span (gives you an area that can be governed by its own local command set)
    strong (bold)

Block vs inline elements
# ADD COMPARISON HERE
* block level
    * occupies 100% of available width
    will be 
* inline
    *  is normally placed within block

comments begin with `<!--` and ends with `-->`
<!-- hey, html comments work for general markdown because it is a markdown language!!! -->

HTML Entities
    * escape sequences allow for displaying special characters as text eg `&lt;` for < so it doesnt get taken as a >
    * & and ; are the start and stop of the literals

HTML Basic syntax
* all tags must be lower case
* all opening tags must have a closing tag
* Exceptions eg.
    * `<br />` line break
    * `<hr />` horizontal line
* tags are hierarchial/nested
* correctly nested example:
````
<body>
    <h1> <em> xx </em> </h1>
</body>
````
* incorrectly nested example:
````
<p> <span> xxxx </p> </span>
````

* block elements form a rectabgular block in the page with spacing below and above the text
    * headings........ADD
* inline/phrasing elements are usec to add features to text
    * `<code>`
    `<i>`
    `<em>`
    `<strong>`
    `<sub>` / `<sup>`
    `<del>`
<br />
<br />
<br />

Span: no styling on its own but is often used with javascript, css
````
<span style="color red"> some special text </span>
````
Image
```` 
<img src="imageFile" alt="My picture" width="100px" height="50px">
````
* *must* include an alt or it won't like it
* for image scaling it is bettwer to rescale on the server to avoid wasted bandwith (we are assuming the image is going to be too big and the server is going to *shrink it*; if it is the other way around, then rescale before it goes to the server)

* next thing after a paragraph starts a newline

### NOTE
W3C Validator
http://validator.w3.org/  

Your HTML assignments will be tested using this validator 
so, validate your pages before submitting them!
plus, it helps with debugging if you run into problems

* test questions will be html displayed with errors and you have to be able to identify the mistake and fix it

deallocation we want to see if the newly free space fits
