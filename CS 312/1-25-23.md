## Three Way Handshake
Msg A to B Transmission
1. A sends SYN, A's SEQ #, and Port #
    * Note: SEQ # is chosen at random for A and B
2. B sends back SYN, B's SEQ #, ACK #, Port #
    * Ack # = A's SEQ # + 1
3. A sends back SYN, SEQ #, Port #
    * Ack # = B's SEQ # + 1
    * SEQ # = SEQ # + 1

## Routing
* Worst case routing is the mesh
* Table Router: Fixed router with a list of every address; goes into the table to find the fixed route that is chosen ahead of time
* Split Traffic: more than one fixed route, so if one doesn't work then it can take the alternate route
* Issue with fixed routes is frequent adding and deletion of destination requires updating of the table
    * nowadays technology updates this table for us
* have local routing (table routing) and global routing
* Flooding: scheme of a special usage routing algorithm; want everyone at every station to get this using the shortest path
    * Every system has flooding where it will make every possible route a destination (emergency broadcast)
    * Hot counter: way to turn off the flooding; when it comes into a station it is decrememented nad when it gets to zero it starts
* Evaluating the status of the network
* dynamic routing
* Heading: essentially a catagory
* constant state of building tables
