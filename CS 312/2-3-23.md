## Web Protocols
### The Web
* **Browser:** user agent (client) for the web
* **Web Server:** server for the web
    * eg. Apache (open source), MS Internet Information Server
* **Web Page:** addressed by URL, consists of "objects
    * most consist of a base HTML page and embedded objects
* **Color:** defined by 3 bytes (RGB- they are the additive primaries from 0-255)
    * green is the most important color because the way the human sees is more brightness than it is color
    * 60% of brightness is green, 30% is red, and 10% is blue
    * the jpg color standard of the compression of photographic images has the main value stored is brightness and the main value of brightness is green
* 

## Hypertext Transfer Protocol
* **Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP):** the set of rules that govern communications between web browsers and web servers; *request response protocol*
* HTTP uses TCP- browser initiates TCP connection to the server on port 80
HTTP messages (application layer protocol messages) exchanged between browser and web server
* HTTP messages come in 2 types
    1. HTTP request
    2. HTTP response
* HTTP is "stateless"- the server maintains no information about past browser requests
* *cookies are initiated by other environments and are stated to store your information for later, **not** HTTP*
* There are different HTTP environments and upgrades over the years

### URx
* URI (identifier): string of characters used to identfiy a name or resource on the internet
    * has a lot of information to get to a specific spot
* URL ..........
    * components: 
        * hostname (www.someSchool.edu)
        * optional server port default is 80 (:8080)
        * ...........
