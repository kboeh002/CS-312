* Contention:
# figure 1
* Passive media: when nobody is talking on it there is nothing on it
* CSMA/CD; eithernet is a contention network
carrier sense moble acces collision detection
    * accepts occasional collisons and solves them
# Figure 2
* eithernet
    * stations listen before they speak; can't talk at the same time; they test the line
* volt meter detects the collision and is only active when you send out a message
* Jam signal is sent to reenforce the collision by sending 32 1's
* Contention Interval is the length of time it takes for the voltage to get to the end of the wire; hence why eithernet has a limited interval; the longer the wire the longer the contention interval

* better contention level in the middle of the bus

IEEE 802.1
0.2 (contention free)
0.3 eithernet
0.4 token bus (contention free)
0.5 token ring (contention free)
(The rest are metropolitan stuff)
0.6 metro
0.11
0.15 (made for hospitals- anyone in range is automatically connected to the network)

Binary exponential backoff algorithm

* token bit determines if it is a free token or a busy token
* Free token doesnt have a message with it, busy does
* if A wants to talk it examines the token bit, then if it is free then it will change the token bit in the shift register to free
* once it is a busy token no one else can touch it, and the message follows behind it
* once it goes around the ring it spits out a new free token
* contention environement is a low load environment
    * eithernet works better
* token ring is a high load environment is lots of collisions and nothing gets through
    * eithernet works worse
    * wire distance and data rates don't apply here
    * wont break with a high data rate
    * FDDI is metropolitan area network (intermediate between LAN and WAN)
    * impurely distributed environment (nothing is in charge) so you have to worry that something will break the token
        * so, we have at least one station as a "watch dog" so it will open up the gate, get rid of the trash, and spit out a free token
        * token bus is a software simulation of this

* If A (in figure) crashes then it will never spit out a free token and just continue circling the "trash" around
