## Internet History Lesson
* 1961-1972: Early packet-switching principals
#### Circuit Switch
##### Figure 2: Circuit Switch Transmission
********** INSERT FIGURE 2 **********

##### Figure 3: Message Switch Transmission
********** INSERT FIGURE 3 **********

* Sends message straigt from A to B
* B has to wait until it gets the *whole* message before it can pass it on
* Each *message* has a header
* Large messages make it inefficient because B has to wait till it is finished recieving each part of the message before it can move onto the next message

#### Packet Switching
* used to use circuit switching instead of packet switching
    * circuit switch eg. hear clicking as relay switches were thrown from caller all the way to the destination
##### Figure 4: Packet Switching
********** INSERT FIGURE 3 **********

#### Virtual Circuit Method
* Each *piece of information* sent has a header
* After it gets a *piece* it sends it on
* **Virtual Circuit:** provides a reliable sequenced service
* **Hops:** unit of measurement distance of messages (*not* mile distance)
* **Transponder:** makes it so up link doesn't affect down link and switches over in the middle
* **Reliable Sequenced Service:** makes sure it has all the packages before sending them
* packets come in out of order

#### Packet Switching - Datagram Method
* **Unreliable Non-Sequenced Service:** Notices missing packages and has to find them by going all the way back to the source to replace them
*Note: (reliable sequenced source:unreliable sequenced source) :: TCP:UDP
* Internet (IP) is a datagram because it is faster
* Phone system packets are always the same size
* Internet is different
* **Transmission Control Protocol (TCP):** Layer on top of the unreliable nonsequenced internet protocol and puts a reliable sequenced service on top of its unreliable nonsequenced internet
* **User Datagram Protocol (UDP):** uses the packets from the internet and just sends them on their way
* almost everything is TCP based
### back to history...
* 1972-1980: Internetworking, new and proprietary networks
    * arpinet expansion
    * everyone started making their own networks
    * no small machines at this point, there are a lot
    * kept updating the internet protocol
        * we currently use a combination of IPv4 and IPv6
        * **IPv:** Internet Protocol Version; communications protocol that provides identification and location system for computers on networks and routes traffic across the Internet [[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv6)]
* First field in a packet is the version (IPv4 or IPv6)
* 1980-1990: New protocols, a proliferation of networks
* 1990-2000s: Commercialization, the Web, new apps
* 2000s-today: Rise of social media
#### Pre-Internet State of the Art
* computers are large, expensive, isolated, and rare
* Communication way phone line, radio, magnetic/paper tape
* desired the ability to exchange data programs, messages between computers
#### 1961 - 1972 Early Packet-Switching Principles
* 1961 Kleinrock: queueing theory shows effectiveness of packet-switching
* 1964 Baran: packet-switching in military nets
* 1967: ARPAnet conceived by Advanced Research Projects Agency
* 1969: first ARPAnet node operational
* 1972: ARPAnet public demonstration, NCP first host-to-host protocol, first email program; ARPAnet has 15 nodes
    * Network Control Protocol (NCP)
#### 1972-1980: Internetworking, New and Proprietary Networks
