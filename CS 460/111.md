## Assignment Overview
#### 2/15/23
* make img as background
* need to make a legend
* digital clock
    * in data there are little hints on the time
    * don't need a real clock, just an array of strings showing start/stop times; every time you push the button you are advancing to another scene
* you will move the ships to a new place and bump the clock
* you want to take a copy of this file and turn all the numbers into integers and stick them into an array
    * x<sub> ship1</sub>, y<sub> ship1</sub>; x<sub> ship2</sub>, y<sub> ship2</sub>
* OpenGL likes the lower left hand corner as the origin
    * any other graphics package doesn't do that
* all you need for the clock is a manually written array of strings to the next significant time point

Details:
1. map
2. key
3. legend
4. clock
5. drawing
6. erasing

* hard part is judging which of the pictures to use
* pay attention to the order of events (eg. shoot before the corresponding splash)
* that position is the upper lefthand corner of the image
    * so, whatever size the images are, then you are going to have to offset it to get the center of the item
`#` means "start", so something is going to appear here
When developing...
* build a function that moves an item
* have one, draw it in the center, and then use the function to move it
    * "erase" it by covering it up with the background and draw it in the new place
    * once you have that done you have finished the hard part
