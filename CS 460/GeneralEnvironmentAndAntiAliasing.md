### INSERT FIGURE 1
* Anti-Aliasing: the distortion of something based on the rectangular pixels you are drawing it on
    * corrects it based on how the human sees
    * gives us the jagged lines

### INSERT FIGURE 2
* Treat pixels as an area rather than dots because the smallest size is a pixel
* Calculate the floating point value based on the percentage filled and it makes the line go straight

* heavy compute and heavy storage requirements

### INSERT FIGURE 3
* Clipping: normally a simultanious equation solving mechanism
    * in a 2D environment you have top, bottom, right, left
    * if it extends out past the boundaries you have to clip it
    * in a 3D environment you have top, bottom, right, left, back, front
    * Cohend Sutherland algorithm is just straight lines- take every line and bounce it against every edge

### INSERT FIGURE 4
* Orthographic: doesn't matter how far the thing is, but it is the same size
    * eg. blueprints

* Outcode is generated by hardware and only 4 bits
* Straight lines are defined by their endpoints
* Trivial accept is when both endpoints are inside the box; curves don't work here
    * will draw it and then quit
* Trivial Reject: in multiple different boxes
    * will NOT draw it and then quit

* basic transformations are scale rotate and move and are basic matrix operations
