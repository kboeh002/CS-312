## The Test
* conducted over two days
* first 5 catagories on the first day, second 5 on the second day
* open book, open notes
* don't memorize formulas
* won't have to interpret code

* Answer Types:
    * short answer; one or two sentences max, sometimes single words
        * sometimes you may be asked to draw diagrams
    * numeric (must show work)
* want short and sweet answer
* make sure to read the *whole* question

## 1. Hardware
## 2. Clip
* will be given an object center and will clip it with the cohend southerland algorithm
* will be a stright clip
* as long as you keep the endpoints in those areas you may simplify, show a picture
## 3. Prismitivess
* stright lines
* characters
* curves
* polygons
## 4. Transformations
* have an object with a list of 5 transformations to perform on it
* set up the matrices to perform the transformations
* DO NOT SOLVE, JUST LEAVE THE MATRICES
* will be 3D
## 5. Projections
* perspective projections
* entities and view volume
## 6. Edge Table
* given a polygon and make an edge table
## 7. Windows
* concentrate on reducing communications
* event, output issues
* 5 stages of a windowing program
## 8. Curved Lines
* arbitrary curves, not cubic driven 
## 9. Colors and Dithering
* eg. with x bits per pixels, how big of a dithering pattern would I need for y colors?
## 10. Solids
* given an object which of the 5 methods would you use and why
* choose the most efficient
