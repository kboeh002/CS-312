## Producer Customer Problem
* **Producer/Consumer Problem:** one process produces items, another consumes
    * Assume a fixed "buffer" space
    * producer must stop when buffer is full
    * consumer must wait until buffer is not empty

#### Algorithm
* var n: size of buffer (array [0, ..., n-1] of item counter)

````
/* Producer: */
var: put; --where to put next item
repeat

produce item
.
    while counter == n loop;
    buffer[ put ] = item;
    put = put + 1 mod n;
    counter = counter + 1;
until false
````
````
/* Consumer */
var get; --where to get next item
repeat
    while counter == 0 loop;
    item = buffer[ get ];
    counter = counter - 1;
    .
    consume item
    .
until false
````
* Problem is shared variables can be changed so on most machine lines `counter +/- 1` is implemented as:
    1. fetch contents of memory location counter and store in register r
    2. increments contents of register r
    3. store the contents of register r in memory location counter

## Critical Sections
* Ex. two processes executing sequentially
|Producer A | Consumer B |
| :----------- | :------------ |
|...|...|
|fetch(1)|fetch(2)|
|inc(5)|inc(3)|
|store(6)|store(4)|
|...|...|
* *Note:* the table is the processes and they are completed in order of the numbers in ()'s
* **Critical Sections:** while A is modifying the shared variable counter, no other process should modify it
    * if multiple processes can modify a shared variable, then each has one or more critical sections associated with that variable
* **Critical Section *Problem:*** is to provide a mechanism with the properties of...
    1. **Mutaul Exculusion:** if P<sub>1</sub> is executing the critical section, no other processes can execute in the critical section
    2. **Progress:** if no process is int
    3. **Bounded Waiting:** there must be a bound on the number of times any process can enter the ciritcal section if other processes are waiting to enter
* Performance consideration requires that process's time in a critical section will be as brief aspossible because of the possibility of blocking other processes
    * Processes are in the form...
    ````
    repeat forever
        .
        miscellaneous code
        .
        enter critical section
        code
        exit critical section
        .
        miscellaneous code
        .
    end
    ````
    * and will look for various methods for entry and exit
* *Any real solution will require some type of hardware support*

## Process Synchronization Tools
* **Semaphores:** a critical section is a section of shared track which should have no more than one train occupying it at a time
    * **Semaphore Down:** stop; train should not enter section of track; fail safe design, broken semaphore should drop down
    * **Semaphore Up:** go; safe to proceed to the next section of the track

--- ***Will put semaphores up as an issue for a test question*** ---
### Definitions
````
     wait(s):    while s <= 0 loop;
                   s = s - 1;       (enter, lower semaphore)
````
````
     signal(s):  s = s + 1;         (exit, raise semaphore)
````
#### Use in Code:
````
     repeat
       ...
       wait( mutex );
         critical section
       signal( mutex );
```
* **Mutex:** standard textbook semaphore name for mutual exclusion; each critical section will have its own variable name (mutex is a variable name)

* eg. the blue screen of death on your computer

* wont take a request if it is in an unsafe state (banker ex)

* livelock is where it is locked but it is still moving forward- still executing instruction but not going anywhere
* communications deadlock

* edge chasing- deadlock detection by following the arrow where it came from to check if it is a deadlock
