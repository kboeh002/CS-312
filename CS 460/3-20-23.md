* went over zbuffer last time
    * memory intensive scheme
    * z buffer corresponds to FB pixel by pixel and has relative depths
* Z buffer memory is normally leached out of main memory
    * change z depth to move window from back to front and system comes and draws it
    * used for normal operations, not animations
    * doesn't allow for anti-aliasing because pixel is assigned to a specific surface
* z buffers deal with curved surfaces
    * can get a relative depth of each of the points
    * z buffer works fast
    * is linear
* if closer then change the z buffer and FB value, otherwise do nothing
* depth buffer == z buffer
## ray casting for visible surface determination
* if we want something with better definition to take care of antialiasing is Ray Tracing (Ray casting)
    * we *do not* use ray tracing in real life because it is not done in real time
    * compute an array through each pixel and draw a ray to see if it goes through each object on the projection plane
    * calculate rays for each pixel for each object- this is *not* a real time mechanism
    * when it intersects with the object we use the closest object and do the calculation 
    * this is used for visual surface determination only
    * in shading we use it to show reflection of objects onto other object
* mitigate calculate problem by changing our view volume into mini view volumes
* only have to worry about the objects of the view volume we are talking about so we don't have to worry about every ray for every view volume
* can also speed this up with parallelism

* mechanism for when we get to shading 
* does everything (eg. the size of the transformation)
    * every graphics pipeline on the face of the earth breaks the model appart into primatives and then run through the transformation
    * the backend is different (eg. our machines is z buffer)
        * especially true with layered windows
        * antialiasing is not necessary in a z buffer environment due to parallel layered windows
### Calculating for spheres
* spheres are trivial (easiest thing)
## Ray casting for lighting--- Shading
* ***LOOK AT GENERAL ILLUMINATION EQUATION***
### Direct lighting
* have direct and indirect (reflection/ambient light) for objects
* intensity of light at a certain point
* term for every point light source that can hit the object
    * I = I<sub>a</sub> + I<sub>p<sub>1</sub></sub> + I<sub>p<sub>2</sub></sub> + ... + I<sub>p<sub>n</sub></sub>
* colors are also important here and must be accounted for in the general illumination equation (the way we would normally do this)
    * ambient light is completely fake; the point light sources contribute to the ambient light and is treated as a source even though it isn't really a source
* can turn off all light sources and ambient light is still there- method is called radiocity becuase in the equation they are not related
    * we do a lot of shortcuts to calculate it
* shading is a computational nightmare
* cant do this in real time for photorealism
* every frame to some extent is edited
