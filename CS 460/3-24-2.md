* middle way of doing it is a double z buffer but this leads to using a lot of z buffers
* recursive ray tracing does everything
    * form shadows naturally
* radiocity: an engineering technique for estimating radiating heat
* we can model light using radiocity- ambient light *is* radiocity
* was employed in the ambient light scheme
* not the modern method, is used to estimate heat transfer
* fractols have been studied for a long time and aren't very complicated
* mandle brote snowflake model- compute power used to generate things from simple models
