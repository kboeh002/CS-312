# Colors and Dithering
Threashold management methods:
* threshold: some color value by which everything less than that is white and everything ahead of that is back
* dithering: giving up resolution for numbers of colors
    * dithering pattern: a square pixel pattern; 2x2, 3x3, 4x4, etc.
    * ordered dither
        * only the number of dots
        * number of colors is based on the number of bits allowed for color
    * in a 3x3 or larger the ordering matters and the resolution becomes poor as it increasing

* "Neither dithering nor thresholding is a wonderful option" 



# Arbitrary Curves, Surfaces, and Solids

## Curves
* Arbitrary curve
Spline: is how they designed curved aircraft wings
* knot: where control points are connected 
    * to make it smooth the control points and knots need to be a stright line
## Surfaces

## Solids


# Midterm
* around wednesday and friday split, 5 questions each day
* there will be a review with each section of the exam
