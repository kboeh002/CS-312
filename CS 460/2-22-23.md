# Solid Modeling
* Solids: possess 5 characteristics
1. produce unique results
2. have an unbounded domain ("can I make any solid out of these methods?")
    * conceptually yes, practically no
3. render the object with accuracy (may not always need to be accurate)
4. efficient use of both time (computation) and space (storage)
5. Able to combine with other objects to form more complex ones

Methods to create solids:
* An option is combining things together in a "boolean set of ops"
1. Primative Instances: specific solids are generated by a program 
    * has limited domain
2. Sweep: a 2D (read flat) area is swept into a volume by linear and/or rotational motion
    * doesn't need to be moved uniformally
    * has limited domain
3. Boundary Representation (B-rep): A solid is represented by its surface using poly meshes or bicubit patches, no interior
4. Spatial Partitions
5. Constructive Solid Geometry (CSG): have a base of shapes in it; allows you to build your own primatives

Often a test question:
* Given a particular object, which of these five methods would you use to create it?
* choose the most efficient one
* expalin your answer
