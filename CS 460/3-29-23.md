## Transparancy, Translucency, and Refraction
### Transparancy
* The "Screen Door Method" of transparancy (Cheapest/easiest method)
    * image in the background and then have glass in front of it
    * scatter out on top of all the background pixels a glass color
    * only works to some extent but works easily to get the desired effect
    * used in the past for minimal compute power
* alternate method is the anti-aliasing (blending) scheme
    * have the background image and then take X% and blend with Y% glass color in order to get th look
    * must take into account angle because it will affect the thinkness of the glass
### Frosted Glass
* made by sand blasting it with black diamond grit
* diffused reflection
